## Notes

This is a mirror of my style [NewsBlur Dark Theme by Prognoz](http://userstyles.org/styles/142911/)
hosted in [userstyles.org](https://userstyles.org). And this repository will now be the official
place to distribute the style, since userstyles is basically dead.

This is a fork from the flareback NewsBlur Dark version with some contrast issues fixed and some 
details changed to match my taste.
